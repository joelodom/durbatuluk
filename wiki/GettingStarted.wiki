#summary Getting Started with Durbatulûk

= Introduction =

Durbatulûk is currently in a development phase.  This means that you are welcome to experiment with it -- and it does function now at a very basic level -- but you'll have to know how to build a binary from source code and how to deal with a Linux shell terminal to use it from the command line.

The following instructions are pretty techie, and are really meant to be a tutorial on how Durbatulûk works.  Be on the lookout for packaged installers for Linux and Windows with more user-friendly interfaces.  Durbatulûk needs some more development spit-and-polish before I feel ready to post a downloadable installer.

= Building Durbatulûk =

The current version of Durbatulûk under development on Ubuntu Linux with portability a primary consideration in the research and development process.  In theory you should be able to build the software on a number of different systems, but this document assumes that you are using Ubuntu.

First, install the prerequisite Ubuntu libraries using your package manager:

 * libprotobuf-dev
 * libssl-dev
 * libcurl4-openssl-dev

After installing the above libraries, speak make and enter.

= Testing Durbatulûk Basic Functionality =

After you have a Durbatulûk binary, run the binary with no parameters.  You should get a usage message that looks something like this:

{{{
 = Durbatuluk 0.0.0 Pre-Alpha =

Durbatuluk is Copyright (c) 2012 Joel Odom, Marietta, GA
See LEGAL.txt for license details.
http://durbatuluk.googlecode.com/

Usage:
  durbatuluk --tests (running this will reset sequence file)
  durbatuluk --generate-keyfiles <key_name>
  durbatuluk --extract-public-key <key_name>
  durbatuluk --generate-shell-command <recipient_encryption_key> (command text read from stdin)
  durbatuluk --post-shell-command <recipient_encryption_key> (command text read from stdin)
  durbatuluk --process-message (encoded command read from stdin)
  durbatuluk --process-messages-from-url
  durbatuluk --reset-sequence-numbers
}}}

If you get an error message, let me know.  Next, try the suite of self tests using the `--tests` parameter.  The testing procedure will end with something like this:

{{{
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 27 tests from 9 test cases ran. (11914 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 27 tests.
}}}

If Durbatulûk reports failure of any tests, let me know.  (You may see some ERROR messages during the testing process.  This is normal as the testing process tests for proper functioning under certain error conditions, but the end of the test script should report no failures.)

= Configuring a Durbatulûk Commander =

Once you have verified that Durbatulûk passes the self-tests, you need to configure your Durbatulûk commander.  (This is where you could branch away from these instructions to try different configurations.  This guide will explain how to configure Durbatulûk for a single client and a single commander.)

== Generating Key Files ==

In this example, I will be making key files named `commander.signing` and `commander.encryption`.  When you use the `--generate-keyfiles` parameter to generate a key pair, you will get two files, one ending in .public and one ending in .private.  You should obviously keep the .private key files private.  The .public key files will be used by other members of the system and need not be kept secret.

First, generate your signing key pair:

{{{
./durbatuluk --generate-keyfiles commander.signing
}}}

Next, generate your encryption key pair:

{{{
./durbatuluk --generate-keyfiles commander.encryption
}}}

Just to reinforce the point, let's lock down the private key files:

{{{
chmod 400 *.private
}}}

In your folder, you should see something like this:

{{{
-rw-rw-r--  1 joelodom joelodom    264 Oct 26 07:03 commander.signing.public
-r--------  1 joelodom joelodom   1178 Oct 26 07:03 commander.signing.private
-rw-rw-r--  1 joelodom joelodom    264 Oct 26 07:04 commander.encryption.public
-r--------  1 joelodom joelodom   1176 Oct 26 07:04 commander.encryption.private
}}}

Now we need to extract a digest of the commander's signing key from the public signing key.  Use this command:

{{{
./durbatuluk --extract-public-key commander.signing
}}}

The output from this function is a bit ugly because there is purposefully no whitespace in the output written to `std::cout`.  Here's what it looks like on my system:

{{{
joelodom@ubuntu:~/Dropbox/InfoSecLab/durbatuluk$ ./durbatuluk --extract-public-key commander.signing
Pa/YE5f3zefx1KunIEhtVPlNZ00=joelodom@ubuntu:~/Dropbox/InfoSecLab/durbatuluk$
}}}

The part that matters is the hash that, for my commander, came out to `Pa/YE5f3zefx1KunIEhtVPlNZ00=`.  These 28 byte, which will be used in the configuration files of your clients, must be copied _exactly_ as you see them, with no spaces.

== Editing the Commander Configuration File ==

Edit your commander configuration file so that it has lines in it that look something like this:

{{{
allow_message ShellExec Pa/YE5f3zefx1KunIEhtVPlNZ00=
logging_severity ERROR
post_message_url http://durbatuluk-server.appspot.com/post
fetch_message_url http://durbatuluk-server.appspot.com/fetch
my_signing_key_name commander.signing
my_encryption_key_name commander.encryption
}}}

The current configuration file parser is overly strict about whitespace, so make sure that you don't put any extra spaces in the lines above.  The second allow_message parameter should be the digest of your public signing key that we just generated.  Normally we would not include an allowance for `ShellExec` in a commander's configuration, but we're going to demonstrate Durbatulûk by having our commander send itself commands.

== Reset Your Sequence Number File ==

The sequence number file is used by Durbatulûk to prevent busybodies from trying to fool with your clients (and commander) by sending replays of old Durbatulûk messages.  Every time you run Durbatulûk tests, your sequence number file is going to get goofed, so you must reset it as follows:

{{{
./durbatuluk --reset-sequence-numbers
}}}

Do this now for your commander.

== Sending Yourself a Command via the Command Line ==

Durbatulûk normally processes by posting and fetching from a web server, but we can also do this via the command line.  This section demonstrates how to send yourself a command over the command line.

First, understand that Durbatulûk uses `std::cin` to read the content of commands.  In Linux, we use a pipe to make this happen.

{{{
echo "echo Hello, World" | ./durbatuluk --generate-shell-command commander.encryption >hello_world.message
}}}

If you type the above, Durbatulûk does the following:

 1. Reads the command `echo Hello, World` from `std::cin`.
 1. Generates a Durbatulûk message intended for `commander.encryption`
 1. Writes the message to the file `hello_world.message`

Take a peek at the message format by typing `cat hellow_world.message`.  This gibberish is your original command with encapsulation, encryption, signing and encoding.

Now, let's process your command.  Again, Durbatulûk uses `std::cin` for receiving the command, so we will use `cat` to pipe the message to Durbatulûk.

{{{
cat hello_world.message | ./durbatuluk --process-message
}}}

If all goes as expected, you will see "Hello, world" echoed to your screen.

(Just for kicks, try processing the same command again.  You should get some errors indicating that there is a sequence number problem.  This is expected as it is part of the replay prevention.)

Since the Durbatulûk `--generate-shell-command` and `--process-message` commands both use stdio, you can chain your commands as follows (though it does't seem very useful).

{{{
echo "echo Hello, World" | ./durbatuluk --generate-shell-command commander.encryption | ./durbatuluk --process-message
}}}
