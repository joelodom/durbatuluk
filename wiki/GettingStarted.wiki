#summary Getting Started with Durbatulûk

= Introduction =

Durbatulûk is currently in a development phase.  This means that you are welcome to experiment with it -- and it does function now at a very basic level -- but you'll have to know how to build a binary from source code and how to deal with a Linux shell terminal to use it from the command line.

Be on the lookout for packaged installers for Linux and Windows, but Durbatulûk needs some more development spit-and-polish before I feel ready to post a downloadable installer.

= Building Durbatulûk =

The current version of Durbatulûk under development on Ubuntu Linux with portability a primary consideration in the research and development process.  In theory you should be able to build the software on a number of different systems, but this document assumes that you are using Ubuntu.

First, install the prerequisite Ubuntu libraries using your package manager:

 * libprotobuf-dev
 * libssl-dev
 * libcurl4-openssl-dev

After installing the above libraries, speak make and enter.

= Testing Durbatulûk Basic Functionality =

After you have a Durbatulûk binary, run the binary with no parameters.  You should get a usage message that looks something like this:

{{{
 = Durbatuluk 0.0.0 Pre-Alpha =

Durbatuluk is Copyright (c) 2012 Joel Odom, Marietta, GA
See LEGAL.txt for license details.
http://durbatuluk.googlecode.com/

Usage:
  durbatuluk --tests (running this will reset sequence file)
  durbatuluk --generate-keyfiles <key_name>
  durbatuluk --extract-public-key <key_name>
  durbatuluk --generate-shell-command <recipient_encryption_key> (command text read from stdin)
  durbatuluk --post-shell-command <recipient_encryption_key> (command text read from stdin)
  durbatuluk --process-message (encoded command read from stdin)
  durbatuluk --process-messages-from-url
  durbatuluk --reset-sequence-numbers
}}}

If you get an error message, let me know.  Next, try the suite of self tests using the --tests parameter.  The testing procedure will end with something like this:

{{{
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 27 tests from 9 test cases ran. (11914 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 27 tests.
}}}

If Durbatulûk reports failure of any tests, let me know.  (You may see some ERROR messages during the testing process.  This is normal as the testing process tests for proper functioning under certain error conditions, but the end of the test script should report no failures.)

= Configuring a Durbatulûk Commander =

Once you have verified that Durbatulûk passes the self-tests, you need to configure your Durbatulûk commander.  (This is where you could branch away from these instructions to try different configurations.  This guide will explain how to configure Durbatulûk for a single client and a single commander.)

== Generating Key Files ==

In this example, I will be making key files named commander.signing and commander.encryption.  When you use the --generate-keyfiles parameter to generate a key pair, you will get two files, one ending in .public and one ending in .private.  You should obviously keep the .private key files private.  The .public key files will be used by other members of the system and need not be kept secret.

First, generate your signing key pair:

{{{
./durbatuluk --generate-keyfiles commander.signing
}}}

Next, generate your encryption key pair:

{{{
./durbatuluk --generate-keyfiles commander.encryption
}}}

Just to reinforce the point, let's lock down the private key files:

{{{
chmod 400 *.private
}}}

In your folder, you should see something like this:

{{{
-rw-rw-r--  1 joelodom joelodom    264 Oct 26 07:03 commander.signing.public
-r--------  1 joelodom joelodom   1178 Oct 26 07:03 commander.signing.private
-rw-rw-r--  1 joelodom joelodom    264 Oct 26 07:04 commander.encryption.public
-r--------  1 joelodom joelodom   1176 Oct 26 07:04 commander.encryption.private
}}}

Now we need to extract a digest of the commander's signing key from the public signing key.  Use this command:

{{{
./durbatuluk --extract-public-key commander.signing
}}}

The output from this function is a bit ugly because there is purposefully no whitespace in the output written to std::cout.  Here's what it looks like on my system:

{{{
joelodom@ubuntu:~/Dropbox/InfoSecLab/durbatuluk$ ./durbatuluk --extract-public-key commander.signing
Pa/YE5f3zefx1KunIEhtVPlNZ00=joelodom@ubuntu:~/Dropbox/InfoSecLab/durbatuluk$
}}}

The part that matters is the hash that, for my commander, came out to `Pa/YE5f3zefx1KunIEhtVPlNZ00=`.  These 28 byte, which will be used in the configuration files of your clients, must be copied _exactly_ as you see them, with no spaces.

== Editing the Commander Configuration File ==

Edit your commander configuration file so that it has lines in it that look something like this:

{{{
allow_message ShellExec Pa/YE5f3zefx1KunIEhtVPlNZ00=
logging_severity ERROR
post_message_url http://durbatuluk-server.appspot.com/post
fetch_message_url http://durbatuluk-server.appspot.com/fetch
my_signing_key_name commander.signing
my_encryption_key_name commander.encryption
}}}

(The second allow_message parameter should be the digest of your public signing key that we just generated.  Normally we would not include an allowance for ShellExec in a commander's configuration, but we're going to demonstrate Durbatulûk by having our commander send itself commands.)






= Under Construction =

Now edit your durbatuluk.conf file as appropriate.  Read the instructions in the file for how to configure each line in the file.  To generate the sender public signing key for an allow_message configuration parameter, use

  ./durbatuluk --extract-public-key <public key of message SENDER>

This generates a shortened digest of the sender public key that Durbatulûk uses to make sure that a particular sender is allowed to send the message type in the allow_message parameter.  It will end up looking something like this:

  allow_message ShellExec lXMyZl/M+oW5Nt4kVSIp9i2sMQg=

If your instance of Durbatulûk is meant to be a client, you will need to reset the sequence numbers file so that new commands from the commander will be processed.

  ./durbatuluk --reset-sequence-numbers

Note that if you ever run the self tests again, you will have to reset the sequence number file.

== Sending Yourself a Command ==

For fun, send yourself a command.  To make this work, you will have to extract your signing key from your signing key files and use the output as the parameter for allow_message in your configuration file.  Once that is set up, try this:

  echo "echo hello" | ./dur
