#summary A Summary of Durbatulûk Security

= Goals =

Durbatulûk is designed with the following security goals:
 * Clients should only process commands from their designated commander.  This is accomplished by digitally signing commands from the commander.
 * Commands and responses should remain confidential from anyone with full access to the command server.  This is accomplished by using public-key cryptography to encrypt commands and responses.
 * Durbatulûk clients should be reasonably stable against denial-of-service types of attacks, which may include malformed commands or attempts to forge commands.


= Assumptions & Threat Model =

The following must be true to satisfy the above security goals:
 * The commander's environment (computer, private keys, etc.) must remain secure.
 * The private keys of the clients must remain secure for the content of the commands to remain confidential.
