#summary How to customize Durbatulûk to handle custom message types

There are two ways to customize Durbatulûk.  The first option is very easy and reliable if you have a modest bit of money.  The second option is not too hard if you or someone who owes you a favor is a competent programmer.

== Option One ==

== Option Two ==

The Durbatulûk [Legal license] allows you to customize Durbatulûk for your own needs.  The software is designed to be relatively easy for an experienced C++ programmer to customize as the logic for handling messages is encapsulated in the !MessageHandler class.

To customize Durbatulûk, look at closely at !MessageHandler::!HandleMessage.  This is a somewhat monolithic method where handling of messages takes place.
